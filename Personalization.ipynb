Apple is a forever kind of girl who dreams of the perfect husband and lots of babies, while Jake is known for jumping from one girl to the next.

When holding Ridley Scott\\'s foray into the world of the mob against most average films, \"American Gangster\" looks like a classic, but when compared to The Godfather, the crime films of Scorsese or even The Sopranos, this feature seems stuck in a pair of cement galoshes\\n\\n\"Gangster\" details the meteoric rise and fall of Frank Lucas (Washington), a 1970s narcotics drug lord from Harlem.  In what could be a lesson in an introductory business class, the film shows how Lucas was able to create a monopoly in the drug world by providing a better product at a lower price.  A true capitalist innovator, Lucas achieved his bargain basement prices by eliminated the dozen or so buffers between the opium fields and the street.  He flew to Southeast Asia himself, bought his product and had his family sell it on the street.  With no skimmers taking a piece at each port, truck depot, or airfield, Lucas built a company that crushed his competition.\\n\\nBecause of the skills of Denzel Washington, Lucas is both monstrous and human.  His work ethic, creativity and dedication paint the picture of a man who could have been the CEO of a major company had life dealt him different cards.  Instead, he built an empire described as more powerful that the mafia.  His counterpart (and equal in many ways) is Richie Roberts (Crowe) the unrelenting by-the-book New Jersey cop who brought him down.\\n\\nBy casting these titans as leads, Scott is able to camouflage many of his flaws.  Washington and Crowe both deliver what for other actors would be career-defining performances, but \"Gangster\" doesn\\'t offer the total package of other crime stories.  It lacks the humor and cinematic artistry of Goodfellas and The Sopranos and fails to grasp the regalness of The Godfather.  The most creative element of the film is the Scorsese-like trailer with the retro sounds of Jay-Z`s  Heart of the City.  Many films would fail when compared to the best of the mob genre, so that does not mean \"American Gangster\" is without merit.  With two of America\\'s finest actors at the top of their game and an irresistable story that brushes up against Vietnam, Ali and Nixon, the lack of creativity on the part of Ridley Scott is all that\\'s keeping this from being one of the best films of the decade.', 4], [21482, \"What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: This story is a bittersweet romance and a touching look at love, a breakup and the in your face emotion of an ex's marriage to one of your friends.

This product helps you to access those files instantaneously and easily.\\n\\nThe overall design of this product is great because it can function as both a laptop, with a full keyboard (which I love, and really miss on other touch screen devices).  If you are working on anything that you will need to type for this is a must have feature, it also functions as a touch screen tablet instantaneously.  All you have to do is fold the screen over and you immediately have a touchscreen tablet.\\n\\nThe device is incredibly easy to use, and easy to set up.  If you have a google account set up will link you to all your files within a couple of minutes through the easy set up.  From there you are able to access all your files via the internet quickly.  The great thing about this laptop is that it also has USB and HDMI ports so that you can bring files with you, or connect it to other devices.

It remained well written and full of steam until a little over halfway through. But by the end the book kind of fell on it's face. It wasn't that interesting, the characters lost thier zeal and the story just seemed rushed by the end. Like it had an alternate ending before it was editied out and the author has limited time to come up with another one. Or maybe he just ran out of ideas for the ending, who knows. It was a good read, it was funny and best of all it was different. However, the sizzle and flavor at the beginiing of the story, at least to me, was gone by the end. Would I read it again?

As to the DVDs in this set, this is nothing more than a reissued megaset of the 12 feature length Poirots shown by A&E in the early 2000s and 9 of the 12 Classic Miss Marples (with Joan Hickson) during the 1980s on PBS and later rerun on A&E.  Both series originating on British TV of course.  As they are not complete, you will still need the following to complete your collections:  The Warner Home Video 3 pack of Miss Marple, the 2 Acorn Media Classic Collections or their newly released counterparts in colored boxes with 3 or 4 discs which includes a new set which has 2 of 4 newly made Poirots in 2008 (the other 2 are not out in America as yet but they are in England if you have a multi region player).

Joan Hickson is a delight in the title role.  Ok, she\\'s not the hilarious \"twit\" that Margaret Rutherford was on the big screen 4 times in the 1960s (that set is now available too), but she does a first class job just as David Suchet did for Poirot and Jeremy Brett did for Sherlock Holmes.  2 things you should be aware of.  1) These discs were previously released in 2 separate sets (which I bought ages ago), and admittedly the current asking price on Amazon for this set is less than the 2 combined (heck, it\\'s less than set 2 by itself as I type this).  Point is, nothing new here, if you like me bought the other 2 sets, all this will do is duplicate your existing stuff.  2) Although this is a lot of good mystery, it\\'s not \"THE COMPLETE SERIES\".  To complete your series, you will need to order the 3 disc set released by BBC Video through there deal with Warner also offered on this page.  Albeit, these A&E copies are better than the Warner ones (these are shown as 1 complete story each while the Warner episodes are cut into 3 installments each with their own set of credits, 1 into 2 installments).  But still if you want the complete series, you will need the other set plus this set (or the previously released 2).  If you have a real yen for Miss Marple, buy this, the Warner 3 pack and the Margaret Rutherford set.  Then after you pay your bill, think about the new Geraldine McEwan sets (I have yet to see those episodes, so you\\'ll have to tell me how good or bad they are).

Watch for soon to be popular British TV star David Suchet on London Weekend Television\\'s (PBS & A&E here) version of Poirot soon after, in one of these films, but as Japp.  Finally, 2 other Christie Classics: Sparkling Cyanide and The Man In The Brown Suit, all with all star casts.  Interesting to note, that the Hayes and Ustinov sets can be bought as separate items as well, but these latter 2 appear NOT to be available separately.  If you wanna complete this great collection, I recommend the fore mentioned 3 pack by Lion\\'s Gate with the other 2 Ustinovs available here (Evil Under The Sun and Death on The Nile) and Angela Lansbury (pre Murder She Wrote) as Miss Marple in The Mirror Cracked.

Of course, there aren't any good bands on the radio lately, so I just read some reviews and dove in-- I picked up this disc, Tool's last two records (AEnima and Laterlus) Perfect Circle, and the new Candira disc. I was happy with my purchases (especially AEnima) But this disc really stands out... it's loud, inventive fun and tuneful with lots of headbanging solos, bone-crushing bass and off-the wall but clever lyrics.

Hardly any other characters are mentioned (Aladdin and Jasmine breifly, Ariel has about a two page part..) which that was disappointing to me as I wanted more character interaction, but was left with only the two bad guys that were talked about constantly.

The artwork is granted a little animeish, it's not going to be your Disney quality, nor is it full of color images, it's blue and black colors mainly.

They've never been anything but friends, but they sure know how to push each others buttons. I was really surprised that no one in town realized that all of their bickering was actually them fighting their feelings and all that chemistry between them. Things start to change between them when her quest for Jake to give her his family's history turns into a game of strip questions. Apple is a forever kind of girl who dreams of the perfect husband and lots of babies, while Jake is known for jumping from one girl to the next. Apple is the only woman who has ever made him want more, but his family secrets may cost him the woman he loves. There was fun and laughter, hot and sexy moments, and lots of feels in this one.

They are bulky (good), which means they have lots of padding for the winter months.  They are true to size except the ankle, which fit slim ankles better than someone over 200 lbs.  However, you just have to lace them up, and lay the laces under the bottom flap.  The upper flap barely fits, but the longer you have the boots/shoes on, the tighter you can pull them.  There is nothing cheap about these boots because they have soft leather to make them fit better.  They are somewhat lighter than my white S/S boots, mostly because the sole is light and pliable.

The back of the tongue has too much padding (not sure why they put padding on the back of a thick leather tongue).  I took my craft scissors to cut the top section of covering (you can see where the top section is because the tongue material changes).  Once removing that section of material, I cut the padding out.  The tongue fits well now and it's very comfortable after a five hour trip.  Another note, these are fall boots, not summer ones.

A true capitalist innovator, Lucas achieved his bargain basement prices by eliminated the dozen or so buffers between the opium fields and the street.

The most creative element of the film is the Scorsese-like trailer with the retro sounds of Jay-Z`s  Heart of the City.  Many films would fail when compared to the best of the mob genre, so that does not mean \"American Gangster\" is without merit.  With two of America\\'s finest actors at the top of their game and an irresistable story that brushes up against Vietnam, Ali and Nixon, the lack of creativity on the part of Ridley Scott is all that\\'s keeping this from being one of the best films of the decade.', 4.2668924), ('5 is the score for One of the more scholarship-worthy films of the past ten years is A.I.: Artificial Intelligence.  The merits of the film do not lie in the plot, crafting or acting, but rather the happy dance of compromise by the two architects of the film, Steven Speilberg (director) and Stanley Kubrick (writer/developer).  With radically different ideas about drama, ambiguity and continuity, the marriage of these two artists seemed impossible.  But after Speilberg took over for the late Kubrick and picked up the film, A.I. became the most interesting collaboration in recent history, and to date is the most unconventional film of Speilberg and the most populist of Kubrick.\\n\\nThe same type of compromise is at work in True Romance, a film directed by Tony Scott (Top Gun) and written by Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction).  Without getting into filmmakers on the margins of Hollywood, no two creators are more different.  Disagree?  Try to find commonalities in Pulp Fiction and Top Gun.  And so, like A.I., True Romance becomes a child whose very existence speaks to the differences in the aesthetics placed on the craft of filmmaking by its two fathers.\\n\\nTrue Romance follows Clarence, a comic book store employee with a fascination for Elvis and Kung Fu, and his new bride Alabama, a former call girl who takes pride in only turning three tricks.  After they are married, Clarence goes after his wife\\'s former pimp and comes away with a suitcase full of cocaine.  Unsure of how to unload their new score, the self proclaimed \"minimum wage kids\" head off to California to try to sell their product in one big transaction to a movie producer who is a friend of a friend of Clarence.

Made in 1993, the film features performances by Brad Pitt, Sam Jackson and James Gandolfini (Tony Soprano) all before they became Hollywood power-players.  In addition, the principle cast features solid stars like Christian Slater, Rosanna Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Val Kilmer, Michael Rappaport and Christopher Walken doing what Christopher Walken does: walk into a movie, spend five minutes on screen and create a moment that no viewer will forget.\\n\\nThe earmarkings of Tarantino are everywhere: the long monologues, the super cool criminals and the references to Kung Fu, Elvis and comic books.  But Tony Scott creates a film from the original script that will be enjoyed by many folks turned off by Tarantino\\'s avaunt gaurde form of directing.  The film does not contain a confusing narrative and does not end with ambiguous questions.  Rather, Scott does with this script what he does with most of his films: he makes a conventional film with a happy ending that most people will understand.

They are bulky (good), which means they have lots of padding for the winter months.  They are true to size except the ankle, which fit slim ankles better than someone over 200 lbs.  However, you just have to lace them up, and lay the laces under the bottom flap.  The upper flap barely fits, but the longer you have the boots/shoes on, the tighter you can pull them.  There is nothing cheap about these boots because they have soft leather to make them fit better.  They are somewhat lighter than my white S/S boots, mostly because the sole is light and pliable.

I have thick calves, so the thick padding on the tongue gave me a problem.  Unlike some of the stupid comments about the boots being cheap they aren't.  I kept them because a good quality boot for $79 dollars is almost unheard of.  Now the fix to the problem if you are keeping your boots.  The back of the tongue has too much padding (not sure why they put padding on the back of a thick leather tongue).  I took my craft scissors to cut the top section of covering (you can see where the top section is because the tongue material changes).  Once removing that section of material, I cut the padding out.  The tongue fits well now and it's very comfortable after a five hour trip.  Another note, these are fall boots, not summer ones.  They don't have openings to let the air in, which is a plus for cool weather riding.

After I have them on awhile, I forget them.  I will say the buckle design is not made for cranking down extremely tight, like some people like.  Also the buckle is not secure just because it goes down.  You hear a noticeable snap when the buckle locks.  I sent back similar Joe Rocket boots because the right boot size did not match the left, and neither were comfortable. I wear size 11.5 and the 12 fit glove like, so keep that in mind when you order.  I normally rate the quality to those costing more, but these are five star no matter the cost.

If you paraphrase the words, you have the description given to Horatio Hornblower in the making of special shown with the first (Midshipman) series.  Which shows as they are aging, A&E\\'s vocabulary is slowly degrading.  As to the DVDs in this set, this is nothing more than a reissued megaset of the 12 feature length Poirots shown by A&E in the early 2000s and 9 of the 12 Classic Miss Marples (with Joan Hickson) during the 1980s on PBS and later rerun on A&E.  Both series originating on British TV of course.  As they are not complete, you will still need the following to complete your collections:  The Warner Home Video 3 pack of Miss Marple, the 2 Acorn Media Classic Collections or their newly released counterparts in colored boxes with 3 or 4 discs which includes a new set which has 2 of 4 newly made Poirots in 2008 (the other 2 are not out in America as yet but they are in England if you have a multi region player).  Suffice it to say, nothing new here for those who bought any of the older copies.

Joan Hickson is a delight in the title role.  Ok, she\\'s not the hilarious \"twit\" that Margaret Rutherford was on the big screen 4 times in the 1960s (that set is now available too), but she does a first class job just as David Suchet did for Poirot and Jeremy Brett did for Sherlock Holmes.  2 things you should be aware of.  1) These discs were previously released in 2 separate sets (which I bought ages ago), and admittedly the current asking price on Amazon for this set is less than the 2 combined (heck, it\\'s less than set 2 by itself as I type this).  Point is, nothing new here, if you like me bought the other 2 sets, all this will do is duplicate your existing stuff.  2) Although this is a lot of good mystery, it\\'s not \"THE COMPLETE SERIES\".  To complete your series, you will need to order the 3 disc set released by BBC Video through there deal with Warner also offered on this page.  Albeit, these A&E copies are better than the Warner ones (these are shown as 1 complete story each while the Warner episodes are cut into 3 installments each with their own set of credits, 1 into 2 installments).  But still if you want the complete series, you will need the other set plus this set (or the previously released 2).  If you have a real yen for Miss Marple, buy this, the Warner 3 pack and the Margaret Rutherford set.  Then after you pay your bill, think about the new Geraldine McEwan sets (I have yet to see those episodes, so you\\'ll have to tell me how good or bad they are).  Seriously, these (all the Hicksons) are first rate and if you have the complete Poirot sets and/or the Holmes sets, this would be just as welcome in your library.', 2.1491735), ('5 is the score for I saw some of these on TV when they first came out, and I have to tell you this set is well worth the price.  First, we get Helen Hayes twice as Miss Marple and once as the victim with my old childhood hero Bill Bixby as the sleuth.

Watch for soon to be popular British TV star David Suchet on London Weekend Television\\'s (PBS & A&E here) version of Poirot soon after, in one of these films, but as Japp.  Finally, 2 other Christie Classics: Sparkling Cyanide and The Man In The Brown Suit, all with all star casts.  Interesting to note, that the Hayes and Ustinov sets can be bought as separate items as well, but these latter 2 appear NOT to be available separately.  If you wanna complete this great collection, I recommend the fore mentioned 3 pack by Lion\\'s Gate with the other 2 Ustinovs available here (Evil Under The Sun and Death on The Nile) and Angela Lansbury (pre Murder She Wrote) as Miss Marple in The Mirror Cracked.

I like this series because it puts in writing all that is talked about during the episodes. The DVD's are expensive and when you watch them you have to take notes.

It also reminded me of Jem based on the girls fighting other girls, trying to figure out who they are, etc storyline. It's pretty much a combo of 1980s/1990s anime and girl power cartoons.

I felt like the story dragged on a little bit too much, a little more action and a little less talking would have been ideal, as what action happens isn't very much. I also felt like they didn't go into as much detail about the parks as in the past books and that left me wanting to know more about the parks. That's why I mainly read the books is so that I feel like I'm at the parks.

This book mainly focuses on the Animal Kingdom part of the park and also Maleficent and Chernaborg. Hardly any other characters are mentioned (Aladdin and Jasmine breifly, Ariel has about a two page part..) which that was disappointing to me as I wanted more character interaction, but was left with only the two bad guys that were talked about constantly. Though the story line still moved along rather quickly, I just kept wishing for more characters and more parts of the park. Hopefully in the next book they'll do just that.\", 1.2285473)]\n",

Things were explained nicely for new readers so I wasn't lost about what had happened and could easily figure out the few little details that were missing. The artwork is granted a little animeish, it's not going to be your Disney quality, nor is it full of color images, it's blue and black colors mainly.

      "[('4 is the score for You can always tell when people either haven\\'t had motorcycle boots or they\\'ve own Italian boots in the past.  First, they are wide enough for a real D-width.  They are bulky (good), which means they have lots of padding for the winter months.  They are true to size except the ankle, which fit slim ankles better than someone over 200 lbs.  However, you just have to lace them up, and lay the laces under the bottom flap.  The upper flap barely fits, but the longer you have the boots/shoes on, the tighter you can pull them.  There is nothing cheap about these boots because they have soft leather to make them fit better.  They are somewhat lighter than my white S/S boots, mostly because the sole is light and pliable.  For those who like this style, but not this boot, please check the Speed and Strength (S/S) \"Moment of Truth\" boots which are only $30 dollars more when on sale (truly beautiful boots for the summer).  I\\'ve had my boots on for about 30 minutes and they adjust to where I want them.  On five stars, that can\\'t be had in this price range when you compare them to more expensive boots, so four stars are just right.', 1.4671223), (\"4 is the score for First I must say these boots have a design flaw, and Vega will probably update them in the future.  I have thick calves, so the thick padding on the tongue gave me a problem.  Unlike some of the stupid comments about the boots being cheap they aren't.  I kept them because a good quality boot for $79 dollars is almost unheard of.  Now the fix to the problem if you are keeping your boots.  The back of the tongue has too much padding (not sure why they put padding on the back of a thick leather tongue).  I took my craft scissors to cut the top section of covering (you can see where the top section is because the tongue material changes).  Once removing that section of material, I cut the padding out.  The tongue fits well now and it's very comfortable after a five hour trip.  Another note, these are fall boots, not summer ones.  They don't have openings to let the air in, which is a plus for cool weather riding.  I wear 11.5 and bought 12, and the size in the boot is correct.\", 1.3218669), (\"2 is the score for After 3 years and 100-120 days wading in streams one of the boots failed - the upper is separating from the rubber lower.  I will attempt to fix. I have used the same soles the time I've had them - the rubber studded soles - the strap in back is about to fail from the rubber cracking on both soles. I am not that impressed with the lacing system - can't get the boots as snug as I like. It is convenient to just pop the button up and have the laces release when removing.\\n\\nThe boots fit well and provide good support, and the studded soles grip equivalent to felt soles, possibly even better on rocks with thick moss because the studs get down to the rock. Low rating for the lace system and sole strap cracking, along with the boot failure drives them down to just 2 stars.  Boots this pricey shouldn't have these issues.\", 1.2476947), (\"4 is the score for I looked at many more expensive boots/shoes and this one caught my eye.  It is out of production now, so I took a chance and found they fit quite well.  They are similar to what I wore decades ago both heavy and substantial.  They give you good balance and a substantial heel (which I need).  I didn't give them 5 star because perfection never comes as a sale item.

After I have them on awhile, I forget them.  I will say the buckle design is not made for cranking down extremely tight, like some people like.  Also the buckle is not secure just because it goes down.  You hear a noticeable snap when the buckle locks.  I sent back similar Joe Rocket boots because the right boot size did not match the left, and neither were comfortable. I wear size 11.5 and the 12 fit glove like, so keep that in mind when you order.  I normally rate the quality to those costing more, but these are five star no matter the cost.

If you have none of these, for the same money (maybe less) you should buy the separarte set of these 4 Poirots and the Miss Marple Megaset which combines their (A&E) \"sets 1 and 2\" into 1 box.

I took my craft scissors to cut the top section of covering (you can see where the top section is because the tongue material changes).  Once removing that section of material, I cut the padding out.  The tongue fits well now and it's very comfortable after a five hour trip.  Another note, these are fall boots, not summer ones.  They don't have openings to let the air in, which is a plus for cool weather riding.  I wear 11.5 and bought 12, and the size in the boot is correct.\", 1.3218669), (\"4 is the score for I looked at many more expensive boots/shoes and this one caught my eye.  It is out of production now, so I took a chance and found they fit quite well.  They are similar to what I wore decades ago both heavy and substantial.  They give you good balance and a substantial heel (which I need).  I didn't give them 5 star because perfection never comes as a sale item.  I recommend them to those who want shoes like they used to be made.\", 1.2379434), ('5 is the score for I ordered my normal size and they were a bit too tight (right foot).  I ordered a half size larger and they fit so comfortably.  If you desire to wear thicker socks, then I do recommend a half size larger.  They look better than I expected, and with some black polish and a good buffing they are beautiful indeed.  They really look good with jeans in black, but look great with exercise clothes in white.  I may buy a second pair in the future.', 1.1895987)]\n",
      "Final prompt: 4 is the score for Beautiful boots for the summer, but not for the S/S \"Moment of Truth\" boots which are only $30 dollars more when on sale (truly beautiful boots), and 4 is the score for Good quality for the price, but design flaw on the back of the tongue needs to be fixed to keep you from keeping your boots, but otherwise a good boot for the money., and 4 is the score for Good shoes for the price, good quality, good balance, good heel, good fit, and good quality for the time period they used to be made in the 80s and 90s., and 5 is the score for I ordered a half size larger and they fit so comfortably.  If you desire to wear thicker socks, then I do recommend a half-size larger. They look better than I expected. What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: I'm confused by some of the reviews, but for me they fit so comfortably.  After I have them on awhile, I forget them.  I will say the buckle design is not made for cranking down extremely tight, like some people like.  Also the buckle is not secure just because it goes down.  You hear a noticeable snap when the buckle locks.  I sent back similar Joe Rocket boots because the right boot size did not match the left, and neither were comfortable. I wear size 11.5 and the 12 fit glove like, so keep that in mind when you order.  I normally rate the quality to those costing more, but these are five star no matter the cost.  They are more shoe than boot, but my thick calves don't allow me to wear anything taller.\n",
